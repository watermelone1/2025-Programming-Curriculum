# How to Read Code

Code is written in lines, with each line doing something from top to bottom
```
1. This line runs first
2. This line runs second
3. This line runs third
```

Comments don't run any code but can leave notes to someone reading it
```java
runMotor(20);
scorePoints(1);
//This is a comment which doesn't do anything
```

As you can see, every line ends with a semicolon `;`.  Think of it like how a period ends a sentence, a semicolon ends a line of code.
